In India, we have double the problem, because all supplements are imported. Usually, these power boosting supplements suggest you to add one packet (or scoop) to water, shake it up and consume it during a workout to give you that special boost.</p>

<p>I call this the <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Fitosoda</strong></span>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Well, guess what, you can now make something like that at a super cheap cost. There are only three components required for this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Creatine</li>
  <li>Baking Soda (yes, you read that right)</li>
  <li>glucose or fructose</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s look at each of them in turn:</p>

<h2 id="creatine">Creatine</h2>

<p>This is an essential part of any workout drink. The big issue however is this – creatine cannot impact you instantly. It impacts you over weeks. However, you might as well get the recommended dose (~5g) as part of your workout drink. Plus there is evidence that Creatine uptake is <em>slightly</em> better when ingested post-workout (or as close to after workout).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23919405" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23919405', 'The effects of pre versus post workout supplementation of creatine monohydrate on body composition and strength.']);"><strong>The effects of pre versus post workout supplementation of creatine monohydrate on body composition and strength.</strong></a></p>

  <p>Creatine supplementation plus resistance exercise increases fat-free mass and strength. Based on the magnitude inferences it appears that consuming creatine immediately post-workout is superior to pre-workout vis a vis body composition and strength.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="baking-soda-or-nahco3">Baking Soda or NAHCO3</h2>

<p>(also known as <em>meetha soda</em> in India)</p>

<p>This might seem strange to a lot of you, however baking soda has long been known as a highly ergogenic (performance enhancing) compound for athletes. There is an even higher effect, when it is combined with creatine as the study below shows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23254493" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23254493', 'Effects of combined creatine and sodium bicarbonate supplementation on repeated sprint performance in trained men.']);"><strong>Effects of combined creatine and sodium bicarbonate supplementation on repeated sprint performance in trained men.</strong></a></p>

  <p>Combining creatine and sodium bicarbonate supplementation increased peak and mean power and had the greatest attenuation of decline in relative peak power over the 6 repeated sprints. These data suggest that combining these 2 supplements may be advantageous for athletes participating in high-intensity, intermittent exercise.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23531361" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23531361', 'Multiday acute sodium bicarbonate intake improves endurance capacity and reduces acidosis in men.']);"><strong>Multiday acute sodium bicarbonate intake improves endurance capacity and reduces acidosis in men.</strong></a></p>

  <p>Ingestion of one single NaHCO3 dose per day before the competition during multiday competitions or tournaments might be a valuable strategy for performance enhancement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the <strong>Fitosoda</strong>, the recommended dosage is anywhere from 0.3-0.5 g/kg of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">total body mass</span> (I couldnt find studies calculating it according to lean body mass). No most of this research is focused around endurance training. However, a recent study shows that baking soda has the same impact on resistance training activities.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22941193" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22941193', 'Sodium bicarbonate supplementation improves hypertrophy-type resistance exercise performance']);"><b>Sodium bicarbonate supplementation improves hypertrophy-type resistance exercise performance</b></a></p>

  <p>NaHCO(3) administration resulted in significantly more total repetitions than placebo (NaHCO(3): 139.8 ± 13.2, placebo: 134.4 ± 13.5), as well as significantly greater blood [Lac(-)] after the exercise protocol (NaHCO(3): 17.92 ± 2.08, placebo: 15.55 ± 2.50 mM, P &lt; 0.05). These findings demonstrate ergogenic efficacy for NaHCO(3) during HRE and warrant further investigation into chronic training applications.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24126895" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24126895', 'The effect of sodium bicarbonate ingestion on back squat and bench press exercise to failure']);"><strong>The effect of sodium bicarbonate ingestion on back squat and bench press exercise to failure</strong></a></p>

  <p>Mean ± SD of total repetitions was 31.3 ± 15.3 and 24.6 ± 16.2 for back squat and 28.7 ± 12.2 and 26.7 ± 10.2 for bench press in NaHCO3 and placebo.</p>

  <p>The results of this study suggest that sodium bicarbonate ingestion can enhance resistance exercise performance using a repetition to failure protocol in the first exercise in a resistance exercise session.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is showing almost a 25% increase in squats! That blows away the 2-3% performance increase that something like beta-alanine gives (not to mention, being much more expensive).</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Most studies I have seen recommend about 0.3grams/kg of bodyweight. Empirically, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one semi-heaped teaspoon</span>  roughly measures to be about 8 grams of baking soda. One of the side effects of baking soda, if you drink it too quickly is loose motions, so I recommend that you space this over a period of 2-3 hours. Please be careful if you are sodium sensitive.</p>

<h2 id="glucose-or-fructose">Glucose or Fructose</h2>

<p>Now, there is a lot of controversy on whether glucose or fructose is better for workout and for general overall health.</p>

<p>For example, one study shows that insulin response of fructose was slightly better than that of glucose.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23746558" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23746558', 'Change in postprandial substrate oxidation after a high-fructose meal is related to body mass index in healthy men.']);">Change in postprandial substrate oxidation after a high-fructose meal is related to body mass index in healthy men.</a></p>

  <p>In healthy nonobese men, BMI correlates with altered postprandial fat oxidation after a high-fructose mixed meal. The metabolic response to a high-fructose meal may be modulated by BMI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, another pointed out that they were the same.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23872500" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23872500', 'No Difference Between High-Fructose and High-Glucose Diets on Liver Triacylglycerol or Biochemistry in Healthy Overweight Men.']);">No Difference Between High-Fructose and High-Glucose Diets on Liver Triacylglycerol or Biochemistry in Healthy Overweight Men.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could use this opportunity to add flavor to drinks – e.g. Tang !!</p>

<p>This <strong>Fitosoda</strong> would be as good as every one of the expensive drinks on the market – remember that I have deliberately chosen to leave out caffeine, beta alanine, etc. because a) they will significantly increase the cost and b) there is not a corresponding increase in performance.</p>
