<p>One of my friends has been diagnosed with very high blood sugar. He has always been diabetic, but being in a food service industry, does take its toll I guess. I am attempting to combine all the related information in this one article rather than divide it among many posts in an attempt to increase pageviews.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Solutions given are around (especially in India):</p>

<ul>
  <li>eat karela (bitter gourd) to reduce blood sugar</li>
  <li>eat neem or mulberry leaves to reduce blood sugar</li>
  <li>do yoga</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Very interesting – however, they do not explore the root of high blood sugar – insulin resistance.</p>

<p>The human body is designed to be self-balancing : especially the hormones of insulin, leptin and cortisol. Leptin is the hormone which controls satiety, so ideally your body should respond with the “I’m full” signal when it has had enough to eat. Cortisol is the “stress” hormone which causes the body to switch to glucose burning as a “fight or flight” response.</p>

<p>Now theoretically, insulin resistant people should not be fat since if someone is insulin resistant, all energy is derived from fats.</p>

<p>However, <a href="http://www.jci.org/articles/view/10583" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.jci.org/articles/view/10583', 'research has shown']);">research has shown</a> that increasing amount of fatty acids in the blood stream and from there to the liver, causes <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC507380/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC507380/', 'induced insulin resistance']);">induced insulin resistance</a>. That is, as you get more obese, you become more insulin resistant. And if you have elevated cortisol levels (as most people in today’s age), it increases your fat storage in the liver.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that insulin resistance develops in obesity, type 2 diabetes, and lipodystrophy because of alterations in the partitioning of fat between the adipocyte and muscle or liver. This change leads to the intracellular accumulation of triglycerides, and, probably more importantly, of intracellular fatty acid metabolites (fatty acyl CoA’s, diacylglycerol, and ceramides, among others) in these insulin-responsive tissues, which leads to acquired insulin signaling defects and insulin resistance (Figure <a href="http://www.jci.org/articles/view/10583#F2" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.jci.org/articles/view/10583#F2', '2']);" id="#F2-link">2</a>, bottom).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Usually, years of bad diet causes a very, very gradual increase in insulin resistance – leading to a full on resistant body and possibly type-2 diabetes.</span></p>

<p>There are a few studies that have examined the complex relationship between smoking and insulin resistance – remember that stopping smoking increases the risk for type 2 diabetes. Surprising, but usually this is because of weight gain. Cigarette smoking increases energy expenditure and lipid mobilization.</p>

<p> </p>

  <p>This experiment is the first in humans to show that intermittent fasting increases insulin-mediated glucose uptake rates, and the findings are compatible with the thrifty gene concept.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A 14-16 hour fast everyday would be extremely helpful for controlling your weight as well as restarting your insulin sensitivity. Note that women need to careful here, because too long a fast can disrupt their menstrual cycles – which is why it is recommended that they fast for no more than 14 hours.</p>

<p>The greatest risk for diabetics engaged in moderate exercise is a gradual decline in blood sugar that can result in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_hypoglycemia" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_hypoglycemia', 'hypoglycemia']);">hypoglycemia</a>.

  <p itemprop="headline">
  The decline in blood glucose levels is less with intermittent high-intensity exercise (IHE) compared with MOD during both exercise and recovery in individuals with type 1 diabetes.

</p>

  <p>In summary, this study shows that the high-intensity bouts associated with IHE stimulate a more rapid and greater increment in endogenous glucose production during exercise than MOD (moderate exercise) alone. During early recovery from exercise, glucose utilization declines rapidly following IHE, whereas it remains elevated after MOD despite the performance of more total work. Consistent with these findings, a lower GIR (Glucose Infusion Rate) required to maintain euglycemia was observed immediately following IHE compared with MOD.</p>

<h3 id="iv-pharmaceuticals">IV. Pharmaceuticals</h3>

<p>Warning: you need to talk to a physician, before following this blindly</p>

<p>Drugs like Metformin have substantial research behind them demonstrating efficacy in controlling insulin resistance. There are several others and all of them are viable without getting into the “no drugs is the best policy” bullshit. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You are already screwed up – not using pharma isnt going to make it go away.</span></p>

<h3 id="v-increase-your-protein-intake">V.  Increase your protein intake</h3>

<p>Preferably consume a slow digesting protein like meat or casein (if you are vegetarian)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22705093" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22705093', 'Combining protein and carbohydrate increases postprandial insulin levels but does not improve glucose response in patients with type 2 diabetes.']);"><strong>Combining protein and carbohydrate increases postprandial insulin levels but does not improve glucose response in patients with type 2 diabetes.</strong></a></p>

  <p>Combining carbohydrate with protein can elevate postprandial insulin levels, but decreases insulin action, and therefore does not improve glucose response in T2D subjects. Our results further suggest that different types of proteins (i.e., fast-absorbing whey/soy vs. slow-absorbing casein) differently modulate insulin response and insulin action. A fast-absorbing protein mixture reduces insulin action to a greater extent than a slow-absorbing protein, and therefore may not be recommended for glycemic control in T2D patients.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Borel et al. report that a shorter sleep duration is correlated with higher HbA1c levels in patients with type 1 diabetes. This might (in my opinion), extend to other types of diabetes or insulin insensitivity.</p>

<h3 id="vii-cut-down-on-acid-load">VII. Cut down on acid load</h3>

<p>A study of more than 60 000 women has shown that higher overall acidity of the diet, regardless of the individual foods making up that diet, increases the risk of type 2 diabetes. ost importantly from a blood-sugar control perspective, increasing acidosis can reduce the ability of insulin to bind at appropriate receptors in the body, and reduce insulin sensitivity.</p>

<p>(btw, coffee constitutes an alkaline load!)</p>

<h3 id="ix-fruits-are-good8230-not"> IX. Fruits are good…. not!</h3>

<p>There has been a lot of debate and in fact, a lot of amateur household advice going around about how fruits and fruit juices are good for you in a diabetic condition. However research has consistently shown that there is no difference between fructose and sucrose on the body’s metabolic processes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23872500" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23872500', ' No difference between high-fructose and high-glucose diets on liver triacylglycerol or biochemistry in healthy overweight men.']);">No difference between high-fructose and high-glucose diets on liver triacylglycerol or biochemistry in healthy overweight men.</a></p>

  <p>In the isocaloric period, overweight men who were on a high-fructose or a high-glucose diet did not develop any significant changes in hepatic concentration of TAGs or serum levels of liver enzymes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would seriously recommend that both sucrose and glucose be restricted during this period as well as other carbs.</p>

<p>Do note that there are a few studies that show that fructose is better than glucose – but this is primarily funded by ILSI (an industry group with ties to High Fructose Corn Syrup manufacturers). For example,</p>
