<p>HIT is comprised of brief periods of high-intensity exercise interposed with recovery periods at a lower intensity. Possible mechanisms underlying the HIIE-induced fat loss effect include increased exercise and postexercise fat oxidation and decreased postexercise appetite.</p>

<p>One of the best resources to read about HIT has been the Hindawi open-access journal article <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jobes/2011/868305/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jobes/2011/868305/', 'High-Intensity Intermittent Exercise and Fat Loss ']);">High-Intensity Intermittent Exercise and Fat Loss </a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Some of the  following papers from PUBMED illustrate why HIIT may be far superior to steady state cardio for fat-loss.</p>

      <em>Despite exercising half the time, HIIE subjects in the present study lost 11.2% of total FM with SSE subjects experiencing no fat loss. Collectively, these results demonstrate that intermittent sprinting compared to SEE is a more effective and efficient way of controlling body composition. However, our estimates of energy expenditure and intake lack sufficient precision to comfortably conclude that energy balance was unaffected in the HIIE condition. Thus, it is feasible that the change in FM that occurred in HIIE may have been influenced by unreported changes in diet. Indeed, HIIE-induced suppressed diet intake may be one of a number of possible factors underlying the fat loss effect of HIIE.<sup><a href="http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v32/n4/full/0803781a.html#bib11" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v32/n4/full/0803781a.html#bib11', '11']);">11</a></sup> For example, HIIE may have suppressed appetite or decreased attraction for energy-dense foods.<sup><a href="http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v32/n4/full/0803781a.html#bib24" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v32/n4/full/0803781a.html#bib24', '24']);">24</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v32/n4/full/0803781a.html#bib25" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v32/n4/full/0803781a.html#bib25', '25']);">25</a></sup> Another explanation for the HIIE fat loss effects is that this type of exercise may result in enhanced lipid utilization.

      <em>Central adiposity diminished in the HIIE compared to the SSE and CONT groups. The HIIE group decreased central abdominal fat by 9.5%, in contrast to the SSE group, which had a 10.5% increase.

Thus, it is likely that HIIE would have an even greater fat-reducing effect on individuals possessing larger abdominal fat stores. DEXA does not directly measure visceral fat, but there is a relationship between DEXA measured abdominal FM and visceral fat.</em>

<p><strong>Optimum intervals –</strong> According to the PUBMED paper : <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17313282" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17313282', 'Physiological responses to interval training sessions at velocities associated with VO2max']);"><em><strong>Physiological responses to interval training sessions at velocities associated with VO2max</strong></em></a> – High intensity, short-duration 2:1 Work/Rest intervals appear to produce responses that may benefit both aerobic and anaerobic energy system development. That means 60 seconds high intensity work and 30 seconds rest.</p>

<p><strong>Optimum volume – </strong>There was a very interesting study done by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rosenkilde%20M%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=22855277" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rosenkilde%20M%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=22855277', 'Rosenkilde']);">Rosenkilde</a> et al “<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22855277" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22855277', 'Body fat loss and compensatory mechanisms in response to different doses of aerobic exercise&#8211;a randomized controlled trial in overweight sedentary males.']);"><strong>Body fat loss and compensatory mechanisms in response to different doses of aerobic exercise–a randomized controlled trial in overweight sedentary males.</strong></a>“.  This study tried to answer the eternal question – Weight loss programmes often  result in compensatory mechanisms meant to defeat weight loss – eg. lower metabolic rate and increased hunger. How does one trigger these mechanisms ?</p>

<p>Three groups were created –  a sedentary control group, a group who performed 30 minutes of exercise daily for 13 weeks, and a third group which did 60 minutes of exercise daily for 13 weeks. The moderate volume group burned 300 calories per workout while the high volume groupburned  600 calories a day. The moderate volume group achieved a greater average weight loss (3.6kg versus 2.7kg) as well as greater body fat loss (4kg versus 3.8kg). Although the high volume subjects burned off twice as many calories while training, they offset this greater calorie burn. In fact, energy balance was 83% more negative than expected in the moderate volume subjects, but 20% less than expected in the high volume group.</p>

<p>On the surface, his study suggests that keeping overall exercise volume down, it can lead to better results than a larger volume. However, please remember that these are in moderately overweight individuals and those that are untrained.</p>

<p>This could be the reason why HIIT may promote muscle growth in addition to enhanced mTor signalling according to the following paper</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22268492" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22268492', 'Sprint exercise enhances skeletal muscle p70S6k phosphorylation and more so in women than in men.']);"><strong>Sprint exercise enhances skeletal muscle p70S6k phosphorylation and more so in women than in men.</strong></a></em></p>

  <p><em>It is concluded that repeated 30-s all-out bouts of sprint exercise separated by 20 min of rest increases Akt/mTOR signalling in skeletal muscle. Secondly, signalling downstream of mTOR was stronger in women than in men after sprint exercise indicated by the increased phosphorylation of p70S6k.</em></p>

<h2 id="caveats">caveats</h2>

  <p><em>We provide novel data by demonstrating that acute HIT and CONT running (when matched for average intensity, duration, and work done) induces similar activation of molecular signaling pathways associated with regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, this is the first report of contraction-induced p53 phosphorylation in human skeletal muscle, thus highlighting an additional pathway by which exercise may initiate mitochondrial biogenesis.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a fairly recent paper that shows that HIIT and steady state exercise match each other for lots of biochemical markers. However, these are measuring stuff like expression of anti-cancer gene, etc. and not the classical anabolic markers like mTOR, etc.</p>

  HIIT does not burn more calories
</h2>

<p>One of the misconceptions of HIIT is that it burns more calories – primarily due to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_post-exercise_oxygen_consumption" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_post-exercise_oxygen_consumption', 'EPOC']);">EPOC</a> effect. Well, as <a href="http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=153667" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=153667', 'this']);">this</a> study shows, there is indeed a higher EPOC in case of HIIT, but it is insignificant. HIIT truly shines because of its insulin, muscle building and anabolic properties.</p>

<p>In fact there is a very interesting study that measures postprandial lipemia (amount of blood lipids after eating).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The conclusion was <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">sprint interval cycling reduces postprandial lipemia, but the energy deficit alone does not fully explain the decrease observed. Interesting !!</span></p>

<p>In fact this 2013 paper talks about how extremely low volume HIIT improves mitochondrial biogenesis, but does not actually burn too much calories</p>

  <p>These results demonstrate that several mitochondrial protein (but not citrate synthase activity), PGC-1<em>α</em> protein content, and exercise capacity can be improved in onl<strong>y 4 min of total training time per day, 4 days per wk</strong> using HIT cycle training</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: large;">THAT IS AWESOME!! <span style="font-size: small;">just 4 minutes a day can improve your <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ability</strong></span> to synthesize muscle and burn fat.</span></span></p>

  <p>Forty-eight overweight children (age: 10.4 ± 0.9 years) were randomly assigned to either intervention or control group. Lower and higher intensity intermittent exercise groups (LIIE and HIIE) performed intermittent running three times a week.</p>

  <p>, HIIE had a significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher percentage reduction in sum of skinfolds (i.e. calf and triceps), and significantly (p &lt; 0.05) fewer steps during the functional obstacle performance, as compared with LIIE and control group. Significant improvement (p &lt; 0.05) was found in intermittent aerobic endurance for HIIE as compared to the control group.</p>
