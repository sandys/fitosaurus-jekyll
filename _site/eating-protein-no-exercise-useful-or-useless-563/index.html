<p>Well almost. I have been asking myself the question on whether one should continue to eat protein without a sufficient exercise regimen (resistance/weight training exercise to be precise).</p>

<p>And the answer seems more and more to be no.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Here are two studies which seem to point in that direction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19470803" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19470803', 'Large-scale mRNA analysis of female skeletal muscles during 60 days of bed rest with and without exercise or dietary protein supplementation as countermeasures.']);"><strong>Large-scale mRNA analysis of female skeletal muscles during 60 days of bed rest with and without exercise or dietary protein supplementation as countermeasures.</strong></a></p>

  <p>Exercise countermeasure demonstrated drastic compensatory effects, decreasing the number of differentially expressed mRNAs by 89 and 96% in SOL and VL, respectively. In contrast, nutrition countermeasure had moderate effects and decreased the number of differentially-expressed transcripts by 40 and 25% in SOL and VL. Together, these data present a systematic, global and comprehensive view of the adaptive response of female muscle to long-term atrophy.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24108315" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24108315', 'Disuse impairs the muscle protein synthetic response to protein ingestion in healthy men.']);"><strong>Disuse impairs the muscle protein synthetic response to protein ingestion in healthy men.</strong></a></p>

  <p>A short period of muscle disuse impairs the muscle protein synthetic response to dietary protein intake in vivo in healthy young men. Thus, anabolic resistance to protein ingestion contributes significantly to the loss of muscle mass that is observed during disuse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would say that if you are not pushing yourself to do exercise, don’t bother eating a lot of protein/supplements – they wont nearly have as much impact.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> There are ways to get a little ahead without exercise, but not too much. For example, by eating omega 3 fatty acids:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21159787" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21159787', 'Dietary omega-3 fatty acid supplementation increases the rate of muscle protein synthesis in older adults: a randomized controlled trial.']);"><strong>Dietary omega-3 fatty acid supplementation increases the rate of muscle protein synthesis in older adults: a randomized controlled trial.</strong></a></p>

  <p>Omega-3 fatty acids stimulate muscle protein synthesis in older adults and may be useful for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia. This trial was registered at clinical trials.gov as NCT00794079.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does protein requirements (assuming you are exercising) change on a diet ?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24092765" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24092765', 'A Systematic Review of Dietary Protein During Caloric Restriction in Resistance Trained Lean Athletes: A Case for Higher Intakes.']);"><strong>A Systematic Review of Dietary Protein During Caloric Restriction in Resistance Trained Lean Athletes: A Case for Higher Intakes.</strong></a></p>

  <p>Protein needs for energy-restricted resistance-trained athletes are likely 2.3-3.1g/kg of FFM scaled upwards with severity of caloric restriction and leanness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Conclusion – very likely your protein requirement rises during a calorifically restricted diet. However, not by too much !!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12094125" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12094125', 'Effects of high-calorie supplements on body composition and muscular strength following resistance training']);">Effects of high-calorie supplements on body composition and muscular strength following resistance training</a></p>

  <p>Results indicate that high-calorie supplements are effective in increasing BM and FFM when combined with RT. However, once individual protein requirements are met, energy content of the diet has the largest effect on body composition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A very recent study by Henning et all comes to the conclusion that even eating upto 2.4g/kg of protein does not compensate for the anti-anabolic effects of going on a diet</p>

<blockquote>
  <p id="ti0005">
  <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049514000468" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049514000468', 'High protein diets do not attenuate decrements in testosterone and IGF-I during energy deficit']);"><strong>High protein diets do not attenuate decrements in testosterone and IGF-I during energy deficit</strong></a>
</p>

  <p>Consuming a high protein diet does not impact the androgenic and IGF-I system response to Energy deficit (ED). These data suggest that the protective effects of high protein diets on fat-free mass (FFM) during ED are likely not influenced by anabolic hormone concentrations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>my personal opinion is that a high-protein diet activates the mtor signalling pathway, but without the energy surplus anabolic effects, you will still not grow.</p>
