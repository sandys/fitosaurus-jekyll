<p>This is going to be a running article on the particular tradeoffs that the human body has to make in doing something like jogging for an hour vs strength training (the definition of strength training here is not dumbells, but compound lifts like squats, deadlifts and bench presses).</p>

</p>

  <p>In the present study we, for the first time, directly demonstrate that the smaller exercise-induced increase in glucose uptake in Trained muscle than in Untrained muscle is associated with blunted exercise-induced translocation of GLUT-4 protein to the sarcolemma, leading to blunted exercise-induced sarcolemmal glucose transport capacity.</p>

  <p>From studies in humans it cannot be concluded whether the training adaptation responsible for the blunted exercise-induced increase in glucose transport resides within the muscles or is due to neuromuscular adaptations.</p>

</p>

  <p>Sparing of glucose uptake by inactive tissues and redirection of hepatic glucose production to working legs during leg cycling exercise were not apparent at moderate power outputs. Our data support the concept of glucose shunting to active muscles at high relative power outputs both before and after training. Thus, when viewed from the perspective of relative power output, after training the working limb appears to respond essentially as before training.</p>

  <p>“Players performed a pyramid model (6-4-2 maximum repetitions) with a load increasing throughout the sets. The resting intervals were 2 min between exercises and 3.5 min between sets. The load was increased in all exercises each time a subject performed over 6 RM. The main goal of this particular phase was to increase neural adaptations.”</p>
