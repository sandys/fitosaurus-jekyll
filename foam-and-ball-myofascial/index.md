**PS &#8211;Â **One of the best rolling I have ever done is for my lower back using a golf ball to recover from a bad deadlift session. I had gone for a week without the pain going down. Then, I took a golf ball and put under my back, rolled it into position to massage deep within the soft tissue of my lower back.

It was painful and amazingly awesome. Oh and it worked!
