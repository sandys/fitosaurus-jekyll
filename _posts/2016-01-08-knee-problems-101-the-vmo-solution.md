The credit for this post goes entirely to an unknown user on Reddit who posted \[this\](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/q6bcf/i\_just\_wanted\_to\_tell\_someone\_that\_i\_finally/). In addition, there&#8217;s a lot I learnt from Charles Poliquin&#8217;s post on the VMO solution

## Lets get the terminology right.

The thigh connects to the knee through what is called the quadriceps. Th quadriceps muscles consists of the following four types:
  
·        Rectus femoris
  
·        Vastus lateralis
  
·        Vastus intermedius
  
·        Vastus medialis oblique  &#8211; a fast twitch fiber (meaning: responds better to higher intensity low rep exercises)

All four muscles are attached to the kneecap (_patella_) by the quadriceps tendon. What’s unique about the VMO is that it is the only one of the four muscles to cross the knee. The VMO is activated primarily when the knee is bent past 90 degrees. In most daily activities (and in fact most sports), we rarely bend our knees to beyond 90 degrees. This means that the VMO  develops more structural imbalance  than the other quad muscles&#8230;.leading to injuries such as jumper’s knee. Jumper’s knee symptoms include aching just below the kneecap, and the injury keeps getting worse until there is constant pain reduced leg strength.

## Detecting jumpers knee

One way to detect a weak VMO is to observe the jump &#8211; if you land on your knees and knees buckle inward, meaning that the knee is unstable, that is probably a sign of VMO weakness.

Charles Poliquin came up with the idea for this exercise from working with Olympic skiers to offset their enormous upper quad development and prepare their knees better. Rather than waiting for an injury such as jumper’s knee to happen, it’s smart to perform these corrective exercises to prevent it from happening in the first place.

## Impact on Performance Sports

as a sidenote, people who are into performance sports like weightlifting and squats need to fix their VMO . Pat Mendes is the 2011 Senior National Weightlifting Champion and a definite contender for the 2012 Olympics. Pat Mendes has done a full squat with 800 pounds, without special knee wraps or a super suit or even a weightlifting belt. He was treated by Poliquin for weak VMO as well.

## Corrective Exercise

> Squat down for a 5-second count until you hit bottom position, come up a quarter of the way at a slow and deliberate pace, go back all the way down under control until the hamstrings cover the calves, and then come up until your knees are short of lockout. That consists of one rep.

Do this exercise with or without weights &#8211; either ways it should help your VMO.
