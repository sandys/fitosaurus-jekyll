        Most of the routines you see in gyms and on the internet are mediocre at best, and usually complete shit. This is a compilation of the most serious, effective and well respected ones on /fit/ for each level to help you avoid the shit and just get to lifting. Sets across means all work sets are the same weight, as opposted to ramped sets, which build up to a top set. Remember to do warm-up sets if there aren&#8217;t ramped sets that start low enough to be the warm-up. Chinups/Pullups and Dips are weighted when possible. F means to failure (do as many as you can).

        Your level is determined by which kind of programming you need and best respond to, not by your numbers or how long you&#8217;ve been lifting (those can only give a general idea). Novices can improve rapidly, usually every workout. Intermediates improve on a weekly basis, and their heavier weights fatigue them a bit more. Advanced lifters can only improve on a monthly basis or more, and their weights are so heavy that significant planning is needed. There is no point to overestimating your level for your ego; you&#8217;ll just progress more slowly.

        The point of novice programs is to make you strong. Even if you only care about mass or aesthetics, you need strength. Mass and strength aren&#8217;t the same thing but they&#8217;re pretty close, especially for novices, and having aesthetics is simply having mass and then dieting away body fat for definition. As eight time Mr. Olympia Ronnie Coleman says, &#8220;everybody want to be a bodybuilder, but don’t nobody wanna lift no heavy ass weights&#8221;.

        Starting Strength (AxBxAxx BxAxBxx)
      </div>
      
      <div>
        A: Squat 3×5, Standing Press 3×5, Deadlift 1×5
      </div>
      
      <div>
        B: Squat 3×5, Bench Press 3×5, Power Clean 5×3, Chinups 3xF (add weight when you reach 15)
      </div>
      
      <div>
        The most popular novice program, from the book of the same name by Mark Rippetoe. There are two full-body workouts alternating three times a week. If recovery from the Deadlift is becoming a problem, the frequency can be halved by alternating the Power Clean and Deadlift on workout A, adding in Back Extension (or Glute Ham Raise) 3×10 in place of the Power Clean on workout B.
      </div>
      
      <div>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        Many people replace the Power Clean with the easier to learn Pendlay Row (a strict-form, explosive bent over barbell row). Rippetoe addresses this; Rows do not replace Power Cleans for the reason he has them in his program. Look to another program if you want to do them. Other beginner programs look fairly similar, with some small enough differences, because this is what works.

      </div>
      
      <div>
        A: Back Squat 3×5, Bench Press 3×5, Chinups 3×F, Glute Ham Raise 15 reps
      </div>

        B: Front Squat 5×3, Row 3×5, Standing Press 3×5, Deadlift 1×5

        Reg Park’s Beginner Routine (AxBxAxx BxAxBxx)
      </div>
      
      <div>
        A: Back Squat 3×5, Chinups or Pullups 3×5, Dips or Bench Press 3×5, Barbell Curl 2×10
      </div>
      
      <div>
        B: Front Squat 3×5, Row 3×5, Standing Press 3×5, Deadlift 1×5
      </div>
      
      <div>
        Calf Work 2×15-20 and Wrist Work 2×10 both days. Two warmup sets at 60% and 80% of working weight.

      <div>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        And even for these two, the Back Squat can be done every workout until it starts to conflict with the Deadlift, and then you can introduce the Front Squat, which is harder to learn but works better with the Deadlift.

        StrongLifts (AxBxAxx BxAxBxx)
      </div>
      
      <div>
        A: Squat 5×5, Bench Press 5×5, Barbell Row 5×5
      </div>
      
      <div>
        B: Squat 5×5, Standing Press 5×5, Deadlift 1×5
      </div>
      
      <div>
        This program has more volume at the beginning. After failing two sessions in a row on a lift at a certain weight, reduce the weight 10% (deload). After deloading the weight twice, switch that 5×5 lift to 3×5.
      </div>
      
      <div>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        The most important thing for these programs is the progression. There is no set end for novice progression (it ends when you can&#8217;t do it any more and need to move on), but it usually lasts 4-6 months and ends in a Deadlift/Squat/Bench of at least 2/1.5/1× bodyweight for a man (lower for a woman), but people are different and some people manage much more. Start with the bar on each exercise to get the form, and add weight each session. These sets are sets across. Use your judgment to decide how much weight to add based on how easy it feels (lower body lifts progress faster and get higher), but don&#8217;t be overzealous and cause yourself to stall more quickly!
      </div>
      
      <div>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        When you do stall, that is fail to get all your reps, you have some options. If there was a problem that workout (hungover, tired, hungry) that you can fix, increase the weight next time as normal. If not, give it another try or two. If you still fail, deload the weight by lowering it 10% and work your way back up, probably breaking through the plateau. You&#8217;ll stall more quickly on the upper body lifts; that&#8217;s fine. Keep doing the program at least until you deload your Squat twice and Deadlift once. StrongLifts changing to 3×5 is explained above.

        This is the later stage of being a novice where progress slows down but before you&#8217;re an intermediate. A heavy Back Squat is hard to maintain 3 times a week, and it conflicts with the Deadlift. For Starting Strength, change the middle day each week to either a Front Squat 3×5 or a light weight (80-85% of normal) Back Squat 2×5, and have that the only day you do the Power Clean / Deadlift alternation (other days are Back Extensions and Chinups; Bench and Standing Press alternate like normal). CAMB&#8217;s and Reg Park&#8217;s beginner programs already have the Front Squat variation on the Deadlift day, but if you decided to save that for later, now&#8217;s the time. For Stronglifts, two more deloads at 3×5 brings an exercise to 1×5. After you get to 1×5 on your Squat and deload twice more, you&#8217;re done the program. Starting Strength for an advanced novice can look like this:

        With a base of strength you can now chose between programs with a bit more variation in goals and method. The first two intermediate programs here are again full-body routines focused on strength, but a bit more complicated for the intermediate lifter&#8217;s needs. They increase the weight each week instead of each day. The second two are specifically focused on size, and split up parts of the body worked each day to work them harder separately (one being an upper/lower split and the other a push/pull movement split). The last one is a sort of a push/pull/legs outline for people doing an intermittent fasting program like LeanGains (but it still works for anyone else).

        A: Squat 5×5, Bench Press 5×5, Pendlay Row 5×5 (+ assistance: 2 sets of Weighted Hyperextensions, 4 sets of Weighted Situps)
      </div>

        C: Squat 4×5 1×3 1×8, Bench Press 4×5 1×3 1×8, Pendlay Row 4×5 1×3 1×8 (+ assistance: Weighted Dips 3×8, 3 sets of Barbell Curls, Tricep Extensions 3×8)
      </div>
      
      <div>
        Day A: Ramp the weight (10-15% jumps between weights each set) to a top set of five, which should be the same as the last day C&#8217;s set of 3.
      </div>
      
      <div>
        Day B: First three Squat sets are the same as the first three of day A, and then repeat the third set again. Ramp the weight on the other two exercises up to a top set of five.
      </div>
      
      <div>
        Day C: First four sets are the same as the last day A. The set of three is 2.5% above your top set of five from the last day A, and the set of eight is the weight from your third set.
      </div>
      
      <div>
        The Power Clean and High Pull can be done in place of the Row and Deadlift, like in Bill Starr&#8217;s original 5×5. Start the program to hit your current maxes 4 weeks in. Neither Madcow program specifies the Pendlay Row by name, but they describe a strict-form explosive barbell row, which is commonly called the Pendlay Row (by others to distinguish it from other styles) because it&#8217;s the style taught by top coaches, including Glenn Pendlay.

        Texas Method (AxBxCxx)
      </div>
      
      <div>
        A: Squat 5×5, [alternating Bench/Standing] Press 5×5, Deadlift 1×5

        B: Squat 2×5, [alternating Standing/Bench] Press 3×5, Back Extensions 5×10, Chinups 3×F

      <div>
        C: Squat 1×5, [alternating Bench/Standing] Press 1×5, Clean or Pendlay Row 5×3
      </div>
      
      <div>
        The Texas Method is a template; this is one example. The first day is the volume day; the main lifts are 5×5, sets across, at about 85-90% 5RM. The second day is a recovery day (main lifts are 2-3×5 at about 80% 5RM), which shouldn&#8217;t fatigue you enough to interfere with your final day, a high intensity, low volume day to set personal records of singles, doubles, triples or sets of five. For this version, Bench Press is A and C first week, B second week, and Standing Press is B first week, A and C second week.

        Lyle McDonald&#8217;s Generic Bulking Routine (ABxABxx)
      </div>
      
      <div>
        A: Squat 3-4×6-8/3&#8242;, Straight-Leg Deadlift or Leg Curl 3-4×6-8/3&#8242;, Leg Press 2-3×10-12/2&#8242;, Another Leg Curl 2-3×10-12/2&#8242;, Standing Calf Raises 3-4×6-8/3&#8242;, Seated Calf Raises 2-3×10-12/2&#8242;
      </div>
      
      <div>
        B: Bench Press 3-4×6-8/3&#8242;, Row 3-4×6-8/3&#8242;, Incline Bench or Overhead Press 2-3×10-12/2&#8242;, Pulldowns/Chinups 2-3×10-12/2&#8242;, Any Tricep Exercise 1-2×12-15/1.5&#8242;, Any Bicep Exercise 1-2×12-15/1.5&#8242;
      </div>
      
      <div>
        The notation is that 3-4×6-8/3&#8242; is three or four sets of six to eight reps with a three minute rest between sets. For the second two workout days you can switch up the exercise combinations, like having a Deadlift and Leg Press combination on lower day and switching the Incline/Overhead Press with the Bench Press in position. Lyle specifies that the program be done in 6-8 week blocks, with the first two being submaximal run-ups (the first week is 80-85% of what you can do at the rep range, and the second week is 90-95%) and the next 4-6 weeks trying to improve as much as possible. He insists on two more light weeks at the end. If Front Squats are incorporated, they&#8217;re better as the main, lower rep lift, with Back Squats replacing Leg Press. The routine also works for cutting; keep the intensity (weight on the bar) but lower the frequency (to AxBxAxx BxAxBxx) and volume (fewer sets of the accessory work, the 10-12 rep exercises).

      <div>
        Some people do push/pull programs at a higher frequency (ABxABx, or ABxABxx, or ABxAxBx) but the creator of this one specifically recommends against this, as do other prominent posters, one saying those frequencies are  the &#8220;most abused and wrongly programmed methods on /fit/&#8221; (at least for push/pulls). He prefers a Push Press over the normal Barbell Overhead Press. He also states that for the weeks with two A (push) days, he&#8217;d do 3×5-6 Bench Press + higher rep Push/Overhead Press on one day and 3×5-6 Push/Overhead Press + higher rep Bench Press variant (probably DB) on the other day.

        Main lifts are done in RPT (Reverse Pyramid Training); after a warmup, first set is the heaviest. Second set is at 90% of that weight but one more rep; third set is at 80% of the original weight with another rep. Adequate rest between sets and exercises. It also works to move Overhead/Push Press to workout C.

        Most people do not get to this level. You&#8217;re strong enough both that your progress is much slower, and that the weights you can lift fatigue you much more. This has to be planned for, and it&#8217;s a fair bit more complicated. Starting Strength with the advanced novice modifications had light squats one day, as did Madcow Intermediate, and the Texas Method had a light day each week beside the volume day and the intensity day; these programs here do that on a larger scale, over weeks. The first two programs are 5/3/1 and the advanced version of Madcow. 5/3/1 is both a set, rep and weight scheme for progression on the main lifts as well as various programs that organise these main lifts with accessory work, and Madcow Advanced is a more complicated, periodized, version of the intermediate program. The second two are Smolov and Smolov Jr; they&#8217;re different in that they&#8217;re programs for one lift at once (with Smolov for the Squat, and Smolov Jr as an easier counterpart that works for the Squat or even the Bench Press).

        Do the first cycle with 90% of your 1RM. This is the set and rep scheme for the main lift of the day; one day each week will be dedicated to the Standing Press, Deadlift, Bench Press and Squat. After the month, add no more than 5lb for upper body lifts and 10lb for lower body lifts.

        Volume/Loading Phase (Weeks 1-4)
      </div>
      
      <div>
        A: Squat 5×5, Bench Press 1×5, Pendlay Row 1×5
      </div>
      
      <div>
        B: Squat 5×5 (10-20% lower than Monday), Deadlift 5×5, Standing Press or Incline Bench Press 5×5, Pull-ups or Chin-ups 5×5
      </div>
      
      <div>
        C: Squat 1×5, Bench Press 5×5, Pendlay Row 5×5
      </div>
      
      <div>
        The Power Clean and High Pull can be done in place of the Row and Deadlift, like in Bill Starr&#8217;s original 5×5. 5×5 means five sets across; 1×5 is still five sets, but ramped up to a final highest set. In this phase you gradually increase the target weights week to week so you end up performing record lifts during weeks 3 and 4 (hitting PRs in week 3 and breaking them in week 4, for example). If you miss a weight, keep it constant (but you shouldn&#8217;t be missing at all before weeks 3 and 4). Keep in mind that even for the same lift, you are increasing the weight for the 5×5 and 1×5 separately. It&#8217;s better to start conservatively; you can add an extra week to this session or increase your targets, if you need to. Some people who are new to this (or whose lifts are really heavy) might even want to do this over six weeks, starting lower and/or building more slowly. The main point of this phase is to get the volume in. If your Deadlift working weights are 2x bodyweight (meaning you are a 200lbs lifter and you&#8217;ll be doing 400+ for 5&#215;5 throughout the cycle) it&#8217;s probably a good idea to do lower the volume on that lift to 3×5 in this phase. You can start week 1 conservatively with 80% of your week 3 PR goal, with week 2 in between. Week 4 lifts are a margin above week 3, like 5%. Your first time you&#8217;ll feel beat-up after the last week, but you shouldn&#8217;t feel beat-up going into the second last.

        OPTION 1/2 &#8211; Deload and Peak 3×3 (Weeks 5-9)
      </div>
      
      <div>
        A: Squat 3×3, Bench Press 1×3, Pendlay Row 1×3
      </div>
      
      <div>
        B: Deadlift 3×3, Standing Press or Incline Bench Press 3×3, Pull-ups or Chin-ups 3×3
      </div>
      
      <div>
        C: Squat 1×3, Bench Press 3×3, Pendlay Row 3×3
      </div>
      
      <div>
        Threes now replace fives; 3×3 is sets across, and 1×3 is three ramped sets. Week 5 is the deloading week, though you might need more than one week. Begin using this new lower set/rep scheme, using the same weight as the last week of the Volume Phase. Weeks 6-9 are the intensification phase; it works similarly except that you now break PRs with 3×3 and 1×3 in the final two weeks. No Squat on workout B to help recover. Depending on how you feel, deloading before another volume phase is probably the best. See the alternate schedule below and run it light, focusing on speed and acceleration for two weeks. If you did it instead of this, you can probably go straight back into another volume phase.
      </div>
      
      <div>
        OPTION 2/2 &#8211; Pure Deload (Weeks 5-6, or extended)
      </div>
      
      <div>
        A: Squat 3×3, Bench Press 3×3, Pendlay Row 3×3
      </div>
      
      <div>
        B: Squat 3×3 (30% lower than Monday), Deadlift 3×3, Standing Press or Incline Bench Press 3×3, Pull-ups or Chin-ups 3×3
      </div>
      
      <div>
        A recovery period without much hassle or worry, with a lower frequency at only two days per week (AxBxxxx or AxxBxxx). Week 5 weights are the same as the final week of loading; if you get all reps, increase the weight a bit the next week, like 5lb to Bench and Row and 10lb to Squat and Deadlift. You&#8217;re probably ready for another volume phase after this.

      <div>
        Do not do lower back or leg work while on Smolov. The base cycle is the most popular part of the program, often done on its own. For your first cycle, it&#8217;s often good to underestimate your 1RM.
