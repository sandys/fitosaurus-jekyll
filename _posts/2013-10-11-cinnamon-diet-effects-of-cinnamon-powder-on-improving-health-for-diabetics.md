Very, very interesting paper :

> 
> A double blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial was conducted on 44 patients with type 2 diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned to take either a three g/day cinnamon supplement (n=22) or a placebo (n=22) for eight weeks.
> 
> In the treatment group, the levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA1c, triglyceride, weight, BMI and body fat mass decreased significantly compared to baseline, but not in placebo group. No significant differences were observed in glycemic status indicators, lipid profile and anthropometric indicators between the groups.

> 
> A total of 79 patients with diagnosed diabetes mellitus type 2 not on insulin therapy but treated with oral antidiabetics or diet were randomly assigned to take either a <span class="highlight">cinnamon</span> extract or a placebo capsule three times a day for 4 months in a double-blind study. The amount of aqueous <span class="highlight">cinnamon</span> extract corresponded to 3 g of <span class="highlight">cinnamon</span> powder per day.
> 
> The mean absolute and percentage differences between the pre- and post-intervention fasting plasma glucose level of the <span class="highlight">cinnamon</span> and placebo groups were significantly different. There was a significantly higher reduction in the <span class="highlight">cinnamon</span> group (10.3%) than in the placebo group (3.4%). No significant intragroup or intergroup differences were observed regarding HbA1c, <span class="highlight">lipid</span> profiles or differences between the pre- and postintervention levels of these variables.

What it shows is that blood glucose, triglyceride, etc. markers dropped significantly on ingesting about 3g of cinnamon powder every day. That is very cool &#8211; cinnamon is readily available in India and will probably cost less than 10 rupees per day to ingest 3-6 grams of cinnamon powder.

What is more interesting is that it does&#8217;nt impact lipid profile. This is great, unlike what it looks like! In conjunction with intermittent fasting, cinnamon could be more beneficial because of the fasting results in increased lipid mobilization in the blood stream. The body will start to consume more and more fats in the fasting cycle and consumption of cinnamon causes reduction in blood glucose level resulting in more consumption of lipid level &#8211; thereby reducing body fat.
