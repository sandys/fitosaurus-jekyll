That is, you actually feel tired even though your body is completely energetic.

Based on the following research paper &#8211; <a href="http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/publishahead/Prolonged_Mental_Exertion_Does_Not_Alter.98335.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/publishahead/Prolonged_Mental_Exertion_Does_Not_Alter.98335.aspx', 'Prolonged Mental Exertion Does Not Alter Neuromuscular Function of the Knee Extensors']);" >Prolonged Mental Exertion Does Not Alter Neuromuscular Function of the Knee Extensors</a> &#8211; the researchers found the following conclusion:

> Time to exhaustion was 13 +/- 4% shorter in the mental fatigue condition (230 +/- 22s) compared to the control condition (266 +/- 26 s) (P < 0.01). The negative effect of mental fatigue on endurance performance seems to be mediated by higher perception of effort rather than impaired neuromuscular function.

Very interesting &#8211; and I think something that can be conditioned out of . This gives a very interesting angle of why you have a bad workout after a tiring day in office.
