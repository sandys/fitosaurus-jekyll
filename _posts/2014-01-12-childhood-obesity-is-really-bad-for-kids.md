> 
> After adjusting for age, sex, blood glucose and insulin, Tanner stage, race/ethnicity, family history of diabetes, and educational attainment, children with severe obesity (>99%) had significantly lower preference scores compared to normal weight on all three instruments (HUI2 ; HUI3 ; and FT ). Obese and severe obese categories were significantly associated with lower HUI2 functional ratings in the mobility domain and with lower HUI3 functional ratings in the speech domain.

What it means is that childhood obesity causes kids to score lower on all intelligence scores. This is really bad. Possibly it is the human body responding to abundance of food and not spending energy in brain development.
