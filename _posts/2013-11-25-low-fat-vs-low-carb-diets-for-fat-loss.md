Very interesting study which purportedly shows a significant benefit of low carb/high fat over low fat/high carb diets.

&nbsp;

however what is interesting is that

  * it&#8217;s for short term weight loss
  * it targets abdomenal fat

Weird. I have not heard of very effective spot targetting, so I would take this study with a grain of salt.
