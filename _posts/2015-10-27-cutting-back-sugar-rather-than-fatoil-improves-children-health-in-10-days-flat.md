A new paper by lead author Robert Lustig (MD, MSL UCSF Benioff Children&#8217;s Hospital San Francisco) and Jean-Marc Schwarz (PhD  College of Osteopathic Medicine at Touro University California) hints at the massive improvements to children&#8217;s health with just 10 days of cutting sugar from their diets.

This paper (still in preprint) has been discussed before at a <a href="http://www.healio.com/endocrinology/obesity/news/online/%7B4cac209c-a2a3-4ec8-83c4-f39774e92535%7D/short-term-fructose-restriction-in-children-reduces-sugar-to-fat-conversion-in-liver" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.healio.com/endocrinology/obesity/news/online/%7B4cac209c-a2a3-4ec8-83c4-f39774e92535%7D/short-term-fructose-restriction-in-children-reduces-sugar-to-fat-conversion-in-liver', 'conference in San Diego']);" >conference in San Diego</a> as well as being released in Feb 2016 in _Obesity_ magazine, yet the findings of it are massive.

> **Reducing consumption of sugar for _even 10 days_ , even without reducing weight or calories, has the power to reverse a series of chronic diseases (including high cholesterol and blood pressure) in children.**

This is massive because it does not talk about reducing fat intake or oil or saturated fat (none of which are relevant anyway&#8230; as past I have written in the <a href="http://www.fitosaur.us/credit-suisse-thought-leadership-posts-a-study-in-favor-of-saturated-fats-845/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.fitosaur.us/credit-suisse-thought-leadership-posts-a-study-in-favor-of-saturated-fats-845/', 'past']);" >past</a>) . In fact, Robert Lustig mentions &#8220;_This internally controlled intervention study is a solid indication that sugar contributes to metabolic syndrome, and is the strongest evidence to date that the negative effects of sugar are not because of calories or obesity_&#8220;.

Caveat: Participants were identified through the Weight Assessment for Teen and Child Health Clinic (WATCH) at UCSF Benioff Children&#8217;s Hospital San Francisco, an interdisciplinary obesity clinic dedicated to targeting metabolic dysfunction rather than weight loss. Recruitment was limited to _Latino and African-American youth_ because of their higher risk for certain conditions associated with metabolic syndrome.

This was **not a survey**, but a controlled trial &#8211; 43 children between the ages of 9 and 18 who were obese were given nine days of food <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with restricted sugar</span>, but were carefully given diets to maintain the same fat/protein/carbohydrate  plus calorie levels as their previously reported diets. Very interestingly &#8211; they did add other carbohydrates such as bagels, cereal and pasta ! In fact, just taking out the sugar meant the kids felt more full.

And in just 9 days, every aspect of the kids&#8217; metabolic health improved.

The released paper will have more details on this subject &#8211; but the information is clear: cut down on sugar (even those in fruit juices) to improve kids health. Leave those egg yolks and butter alone.
