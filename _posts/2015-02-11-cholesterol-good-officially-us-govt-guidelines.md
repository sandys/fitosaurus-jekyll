This is huge &#8211; the US government&#8217;s Food and Drug Administration has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/02/10/feds-poised-to-withdraw-longstanding-warnings-about-dietary-cholesterol/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/02/10/feds-poised-to-withdraw-longstanding-warnings-about-dietary-cholesterol/', ' officially decided to withdraw warning AGAINST dietary cholesterol']);" >officially decided to withdraw warning AGAINST dietary cholesterol</a>. Now, you can go ahead and eat all the egg yolks you want without worrying. This was always scientifically incorrect, but now there is widespread consensus around it.

At Fitosaur.us, we have tried to maintain a [balanced viewpoint](fitosaur.us/the-truth-about-saturated-fat-583/) around cholesterol and saturated fat for a long time. We sure are glad to see it validated!

> The nation’s top nutrition advisory panel has decided to drop its caution about eating cholesterol-laden food, a move that could undo almost 40 years of government warnings about its consumption.
> 
> The group’s finding that cholesterol in the diet need no longer be considered a “nutrient of concern” stands in contrast to the committee’s findings five years ago, the last time it convened. During those proceedings, as in previous years, the panel deemed the issue of excess cholesterol in the American diet a public health concern.
> 
> The finding follows an evolution of thinking among many nutritionists who now believe that, for healthy adults, eating foods high in cholesterol may not significantly affect the level of cholesterol in the blood or increase the risk of heart disease.
