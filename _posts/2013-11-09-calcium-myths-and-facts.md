Doctors tend to prescribe Vitamin-D tablets to account for calcium deficiency to improve calcium absorption. This includes recommendation of sunbathing to increase vitamin-D levels. However recent research has suggested that true impact of Vitamin-D on Calcium absorption is very minimal.

There are three studies:

In all the studies the scientists state &#8211; &#8220;There is no need to recommend vitamin D for increasing calcium absorption in normal subjects. Very efficient calcium absorption at very low levels of serum 25OHD explains why people do not develop osteomalacia provided that dietary intake of calcium and phosphorus is adequate.&#8221; or &#8221; The results challenge assumptions about the value of adding vitamin D to increase calcium absorption except when serum 25OHD is very low that is less than 10 ng/ml (25 nmol/liter).&#8221;

These results seriously challenge the role of Vitamin-D to increase calcium absorption **unless** you are already deficient in Vitamin-D (less than 10 ng/ml).
