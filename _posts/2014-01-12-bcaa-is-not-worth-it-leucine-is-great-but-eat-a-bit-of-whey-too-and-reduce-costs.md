<p itemprop="headline">
  Shows us that it is possible to increase muscle protein synthesis eating just bit of whey and supplementing it with leucine. Remember though that you cannot skip whey completely, as this other paper (also by Stuart Philips) shows

>   When comparing the effects of HMB <em>vs</em>. Leu on MPS, we found a robust stimulation (HMB ~70%<em>vs</em>. Leu ~110%). To place this size of response to HMB or Leu in context with a more substantial feeding regime, our previous study of feeding 48 g whey protein to young men (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3690694/#b4" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3690694/#b4', 'Atherton et al. 2010a']);" id="__tag_320872853" role="button">Atherton <em>et al</em>. 2010<em>a</em></a>) resulted in ~2.5-fold increases in MPS over a 1.5 h period post-feed, before MPS returned to baseline over the next period measured (1.5–2.5 h). If this response were to be directly compared with this present Leu and HMB work, made over a 2.5 h measurement period, then overall prandial protein accretion via increases in MPS would be roughly similar (note that MPS is calculated as incorporation/time). These facts are striking and imply that it is possible to robustly increase MPS responses to nutrition by supplying complex mixtures of EAAs but also Leu, and even HMB, alone, at least until EAA and NEAA substrate depletion becomes rate limiting for MPS (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3690694/#b8" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3690694/#b8', 'Churchward-Venne et al. 2012']);" id="__tag_320872825" role="button">Churchward-Venne <em>et al</em>. 2012</a>).
