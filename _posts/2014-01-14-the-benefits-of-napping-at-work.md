This is an interesting article about the NASA&#8217;s research into napping for fighter pilots and how it improved performance. It shows that reaction time and lapses were significantly decreased for pilots who nap as opposed to those who dont.

> The NASA team concluded that naps provided a 34% increase in pilot performance and 100% increase in physiological alertness. These basic facts are often cited by health and wellness magazines as benefits of napping, but few actually dive into the details of where the metrics came from, and what they mean.

If it is good enough for fighter pilots, it is good enough for the rest of us. Go on take a nap in office and be a better employee !
