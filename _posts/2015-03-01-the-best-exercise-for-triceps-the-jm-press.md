Named for John Mark Blakeley &#8211; one of the trainers at the famous Westside Barbell.Â He holds 6 world records, is a 4 time world bench press champion and was also the 11th man in history to bench 700lb (raw).

A JM Press is a hybrid exercise for the triceps, often performed on a flat bench with a barbell. Its blend between a close grip bench press and a triceps extension. Its designed to make your triceps extremely strong for bench pressing and really helps to strengthen the tendons and get the joints and build them up to handle heavy loads. Whilst the movement hits all three triceps heads (triceps brachii) there is a particular focus and feeling on the long head.

This exercise avoids any engagement with elbows and shoulders which allows any damage to your tendons.
