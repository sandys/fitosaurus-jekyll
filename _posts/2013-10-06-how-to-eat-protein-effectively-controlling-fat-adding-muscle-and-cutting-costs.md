In 2011, Dr. George Bray published his paper on protein nutrition &#8211; &#8220;<a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1103993" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1103993', 'Effect of Dietary Protein Content on Weight Gain, Energy Expenditure, and Body Composition During Overeating']);" ><strong>Effect of Dietary Protein Content on Weight Gain, Energy Expenditure, and Body Composition During Overeating</strong></a>&#8221; &#8211;  and his youtube video &#8211; <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv3T6NFfkT0> &#8211; which caused no small controversy.

The problem in today&#8217;s world with a lot of food advertising is that, it is hard to figure out what is good and what is not. Take for example the recent spate of advertisements on Indian TV about cholesterol-free rice &#8211; I mean if it is not obvious that rice does not have any cholesterol to begin with, then there is something wrong with our information sources.

Same goes for protein &#8211; most gyms or so called &#8220;celebrity dieticians&#8221; advocate a high protein diet where you _&#8220;do not have to count calories_&#8220;. Well, this study completely kicks them out of the water.

### The Experiment

After consuming a weight-stabilizing diet for 13 to 25 days, participants were randomized to diets containing 5% of energy from protein (low protein), 15% (normal protein), or 25% (high protein), which they were overfed during the last 8 weeks of their 10- to 12-week stay in the inpatient metabolic unit. Compared with energy intake during the weight stabilization period, the protein diets provided approximately 40% more energy intake, which corresponds to 954 kcal/d (95% CI, 884-1022 kcal/d).

### The Results

Overeating produced significantly less weight gain in the low protein diet group (3.16 kg; 95% CI, 1.88-4.44 kg) compared with the normal protein diet group (6.05 kg; 95% CI, 4.84-7.26 kg) or the high protein diet group (6.51 kg; 95% CI, 5.23-7.79 kg) (_P_ = .002). Body fat increased similarly in all 3 protein diet groups and represented 50% to more than 90% of the excess stored calories. Resting energy expenditure, total energy expenditure, and body protein did not increase during overfeeding with the low protein diet. In contrast, resting energy expenditure (normal protein diet: 160 kcal/d [95% CI, 102-218 kcal/d]; high protein diet: 227 kcal/d [95% CI, 165-289 kcal/d]) and body protein (lean body mass) (normal protein diet: 2.87 kg [95% CI, 2.11-3.62 kg]; high protein diet: 3.18 kg [95% CI, 2.37-3.98 kg]) increased significantly with the normal and high protein diets.

### What does it mean ?

Simple &#8211; consume more calories (regardless of whether it is protein or carbs) and you&#8217;ll gain more weight.

The natural question that arises now is &#8211; what about the reverse ? If you are cutting calories, does increasing protein help ?

well there are a lot of studies around that but several are inconclusive. For example, a particular <a href="http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/5/1/8" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/5/1/8', 'study']);" >study</a> shows a marked lean muscle sparing effect in the face of dietary restriction when supplementing with whey protein. However, a more recent <a href="http://advances.nutrition.org/content/3/2/119.full#sec-5" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://advances.nutrition.org/content/3/2/119.full#sec-5', 'study']);" >study</a> was inconclusive &#8211; however, did support the fact that higher than recommended protein consumption may have a muscle sparing effect during diets.

### Other considerations

We have already answered questions about when and how much to consume protein in a previous <a href="http://fitosaur.us/when-should-you-drink-your-protein-shake-444/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fitosaur.us/when-should-you-drink-your-protein-shake-444/', 'article']);" >article</a> &#8211; that is an important aspect to kept in mind to decide your diet.
