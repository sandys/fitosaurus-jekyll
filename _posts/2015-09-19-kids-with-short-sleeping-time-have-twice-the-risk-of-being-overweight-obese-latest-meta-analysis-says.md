Is Sleep Duration Associated With Childhood Obesity?

this <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25589359" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25589359', 'study']);" >study</a>, which performs meta-analysis of 11 longitudinal studies, comprising 24,821 participants, revealed that subjects sleeping for short duration had twice the risk of being overweight/obese, compared with subjects sleeping for long duration (odds ratio 2.15; 95% confidence interval: 1.64â€“2.81).

&#8221; This study prov<span class="text_exposed_show">ides evidence that short sleep duration in young subjects is significantly associated with future overweight/obesity,&#8221; scientists say.

Obviously, this topic needs to be looked at some depth, since this particular study is just a meta study&#8230; but I&#8217;m fairly likely to believe the conclusions. More sleep is much better than less sleep!
