Since childhood (atleast in India), we have been told to have a high fiber diet &#8211; but the reasons are not very clear. Usually, it is around the hazy concept of &#8220;_it helps digestion&#8221;._ But under the covers, the truth is stranger and much more powerful.

Scientists have speculated for a long time about the effect of fermentable fibers on the beneficial bacteria that live in our intestines. Fermentable fibers are food products that are fermented by our friendly intestinal bacteria (bifidobacteria and lactobacilli; maybe also roseburia, eubacteria faecalibacteria) into short chain fatty acids (also called SCFA) like butyrates.proprionates and acetates. The earliest research (that I can find) is <a href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/33/4/754.full.pdf" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/33/4/754.full.pdf']);" >this</a>.

**Stephen Guyenet** has <a href="http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.in/2009/12/butyric-acid-ancient-controller-of.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.in/2009/12/butyric-acid-ancient-controller-of.html', 'written']);" >written</a> a very interesting article on the advantages of butyric acid on metabolism. As he puts it:

  * Butyrate Suppresses Inflammation in the Gut and Other Tissues &#8211; It also has potent anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. And helpful against Crohn&#8217;s and ulcerative colitis.
  * Butyrate Increases Resistance to Metabolic and Physical Stress
  * Certain types of fiber reduce atherosclerosis in animal models, and this effect may be <a href="http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=17893322" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=17893322', 'due to butyrate']);" >due to butyrate</a> production produced when the fiber is fermented
  * Butyrate increases the function and survival of mice with certain neurodegenerative diseases.

Interestingly, the best sources for butyrate are through fiber fermentation and BUTTER !  For those of you havent read the article on saturated fat myth-busting, read it <a href="http://fitosaur.us/the-truth-about-saturated-fat-583/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fitosaur.us/the-truth-about-saturated-fat-583/', 'here']);" >here</a>.

Fibers also fall in the category of _prebiotics_ since they produce the conditions necessary for growth of friendly gut bacteria.

    Dr. Gibson’s research has tested a multitude of probiotic species and their response to prebiotic fibers. The research has also linked prebiotic fibers to probiotic benefits. Many of these benefits are anti-inflammatory as mentioned above.

      This interesting paper is a research around the exact mechanism of how fermentable dietary fiber (like Psyllium Hus/Isabgol, cabbage, beans, etc.) affect your intestine and promote weight loss.

      <p>
        Soluble dietary fibers promote metabolic benefits on body weight and glucose control, but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Recent evidence indicates that intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGN) has beneficial effects on glucose and energy homeostasis. Here, we show that the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) propionate and butyrate, which are generated by fermentation of soluble fiber by the gut microbiota, activate IGN via complementary mechanisms. Butyrate activates IGN gene expression through a cAMP-dependent mechanism, while propionate, itself a substrate of IGN, activates IGN gene expression via a gut-brain neural circuit involving the fatty acid receptor FFAR3. The metabolic benefits on body weight and glucose control induced by SCFAs or dietary fiber in normal mice are absent in mice deficient for IGN, despite similar modifications in gut microbiota composition. Thus, the regulation of IGN is necessary for the metabolic benefits associated with SCFAs and soluble fiber.

    Now, the reason that this  paper is interesting is that the connection between fiber intake (and its subsequent fermentation) and weight loss has never been tied together. But this research concludes that the short chain fatty acids produced by our friendly intestinal bacteria  (butyrate and propionate) activate IGN gene expression via a cool &#8220;<em>gut-brain neural circuit</em>&#8221; using the FFAR3 receptor.

Here is the gene sequence information for the fatty acid receptor <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2865" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2865', 'FFAR3']);" >FFAR3</a> &#8211; which has also been <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23060857" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23060857', 'identified']);" >identified</a> as potential targets for curing/mediating type-2 diabetes as well as various metabolic diseases.From the paper below, it seems that the exact mechanism that this happens is that the FFAR3 receptors stimulate production of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1', 'GLP-1 peptide']);" >GLP-1 peptide</a>.

  GLP-1 is also known to inhibit pancreatic β-cell apoptosis and stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of insulin-secreting β-cells. In addition, GLP-1 inhibits gastric secretion and motility. This delays and protracts carbohydrate absorption and contributes to a satiating effect.

Now you know the exact mechanism how a fiber rich diet promotes weight loss and other interesting superpowers &#8211; like preventing cancer, bowel inflammation, Crohn&#8217;s disease and maybe even brain damage. It&#8217;s all due to the friendly bacteria in your gut !
