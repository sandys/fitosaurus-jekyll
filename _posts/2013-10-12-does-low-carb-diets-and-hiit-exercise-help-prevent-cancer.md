The <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157', 'TRP53']);" >TRP53</a> gene has been identified as a critical gene for tumor suppression.

Now, new research has emerged that suggests that low carb diets in combination with HIIT exercise may help express this gene. That is frikking amazing news.

> n a repeated-measures design, muscle biopsies (vastus lateralis) were obtained from eight active males before and after performing an acute bout of high-intensity interval running with either high (HIGH) or low CHO availability (LOW). We conclude that the exercise-induced increase in p53 phosphorylation is enhanced in conditions of reduced CHO availability, which may be related to upstream signaling through AMPK.

However, this study has to be taken into conjunction with <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed&cmd=Search&doptcmdl=Citation&defaultField=Title+Word&term=Bartlett%5Bauthor%5D+AND+Matched+work+high-intensity+interval+and+continuous+running+induce+similar+increases+in+PGC-1alpha+mRNA%2C+AMPK%2C+p38%2C+and+p53+phosphorylation+in+human+skeletal+muscle" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed&cmd=Search&doptcmdl=Citation&defaultField=Title+Word&term=Bartlett%5Bauthor%5D+AND+Matched+work+high-intensity+interval+and+continuous+running+induce+similar+increases+in+PGC-1alpha+mRNA%2C+AMPK%2C+p38%2C+and+p53+phosphorylation+in+human+skeletal+muscle', 'another study']);" >another study</a> that claims that P53 expression is the same in a longer moderate intensity exercise v/s HIIT exercise. So the jury is partly out &#8211; however, I would still prefer HIIT because of its glucose uptake advantages.
