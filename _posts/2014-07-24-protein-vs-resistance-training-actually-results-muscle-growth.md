At the end of the day, whether you believe it or not (and even with error margins), I think what it say is that &#8211; it doesnt matter shit that you miss eating your protein on a few days. It also doesnt matter to sit inside a gym and keep sipping your expensive protein shake while working out (also known as peri-workout nutrition, debunked <a href="http://fitosaur.us/when-should-you-drink-your-protein-shake-444/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fitosaur.us/when-should-you-drink-your-protein-shake-444/', 'here']);" >here</a>). But it matters a lot that you put in a lot of solid resistance training, even when you are sleepy or tired.

In the present study, the control group retained normal habitual energy and protein intake  whereas the PRO group was administered additional supplementation efits of amino acid supplementation on muscle mass main-tenance, the control groups generally consumed dietary protein at a concentration no higher than 0.8 g

> One hundred and six men were randomized into 5 groups: low-volume resistance training with bioenhanced whey protein (BWPLV; n = 22), moderate-volume resistance training with BWP (BWPMV; n = 20), moderate-volume resistance training with standard whey protein (SWPMV; n = 22), **moderate-volume resistance training with a placebo** (PLA; n = 21), or **moderate-volume resistance training with no supplementation** (CON; n = 21).

This is the study that caused a lot of controversy &#8211; about how a properly administered trial actually failed to prove any correlation of muscle supplementation (even the mind-game placebo variety) with muscle growth ! This is incredibly fascinating and needs to be studied more.
