## Spine Mechanics for lifters

This is a PDF of an article from Crossfit Journal. I recommend going to the <a href="http://journal.crossfit.com/2007/11/spine-mechanics-for-lifters-by.tpl" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://journal.crossfit.com/2007/11/spine-mechanics-for-lifters-by.tpl', 'original site']);" >original site</a> to read the PDF. A backup copy just to preserve against loss of this information is <a href="http://fitosaur.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/63_07_Spine_Mechanics.pdf" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://fitosaur.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/63_07_Spine_Mechanics.pdf']);" >here</a>.

## Testing the ankles

Use this test to determine how bad is your ankle flexibility. Mine were pretty, pretty bad.



&nbsp;

## Opening up ankle mobility

Rigging up that rope to stretch the ankle soft tissue was pure genius ! I managed to improve my ankle flexibility in a matter of minutes.



similar idea



&nbsp;

## Pre-squat stretch for opening up the hips

Very good stretch workout &#8211; I would rate the stretches below to be better than this.



## Setting up the hips for torque



## Stretching hip flexors

The following is fricking awesome &#8211; the way he locks out the hips with the band to enable opening up the hips is excellent.



&nbsp;

While doing this stretch, try to sit back slowly to stretch your hip flexors. Make sure you stay in position for a couple of minutes. Remember do this **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span> **you open up the hip (above video)

## Reverse Hyperextensions &#8211; Strengthening the back and recovering from severe back problems

The biggest proponent of this is Louie Simmons of Westside Barbell. There is a lot of forum talk around it helping to recover from bad deadlift back soreness, squat form failure, etc.



I do it on a bench like so

Do it on your dining table !



If you dont have access to a bench (or a dining table), you could do it on the floor like so, but I dont like it because Louie Simmons recommends never to hyperextend the legs (going above the head) which is happening here.
