Though it&#8217;s sometimes called &#8220;The Sprinkle Diet,&#8221; the Sensa weight loss method is &#8230; well&#8230; not exactly a diet.

Sensa is a chemical powder (most _likely _maltodextrin, tricalcium phosphate,silica, and flavors). You sprinkle them on food and they enhance taste through smell or flavor. However, Sensa is intended to fool your brain into a sensation of satiety  &#8211; thinking you are full and  causing you to stop eating.

A one-month Sensa free trial costing $9.95 shipping and handling, and a 6-month kit at an introductory rate of $199, are available on the Sensa web site. (The_Consumer Affairs _web site cautions dieters that the free trial is associated with an automatic enrollment plan, and incurs an additional charge of $89.95 along with shipping and handling if you don&#8217;t send all of the product back within 30 days.). Gawker mentions that the Sensa plan is difficult to cancel and of cases of credit cards being charged after cancellation.

# Safety

## Tricalcium phosphate

This can be found in baking mix and helps maintain the fluffy characteristics of most dough products like cake and breads. Tricalcium phosphate may most regularly be found as an ingredient in dairy products such as yogurt, as well as in carbonated beverages, powder based spices, candies and jelly. However, Wikipedia lists it as causing nausea, or curbing appetite.

## Organic vegetal silica

This has many important functions in the body.  The renewal of bones and creation of cartilage depend heavily on vegetal silica as a nutrient in combination with calcium. While horsetail is the pinnacle herb for silica content, one of the best food sources for silica is oats. A breakfast muesli made with raw soaked oats eaten daily supplies lots of silica. In that regard, sensa is supplementing atleast silica right. However, its role in overall appetite suppression is doubtful. However, it may most likely to promote the absorption of calcium products (like the aforementioned Tricalcium Phosphate).

## maltodextrin

It is most likely being used for granulation &#8211; All calcium carbonates have inherently poor compressibility, i.e. it cannot form tablets. Even if  you could try it this way, it would have poor hardness and other mechanical properties. Thus, All calcium carbonates to be used in tablets must be granulated. Granulation involves mixing the calcium compound with a binder like maltodextrin.

Fundamentally, therefore the Sensa diet is basically an appetite suppressing calcium compound (commonly found in baking products) along with some other chemicals to give it flavor, taste and texture. On the surface of it, it looks safe, but it is undoubtedly overpriced.

Secondly, you could have differing responses to tricalcium phosphate based on your overall vitamin levels. Also, based on your particular hormonal balance, you could impact **Calcium Phosphate homeostasis**. It is therefore highly recommended to do a hormonal (especially thyroid and parathyroid test) as well as a calcium balance test before starting on the Sensa weight loss program.
