> Early-life exposure to dogs is protective against allergic disease development, and dog ownership is associated with a distinct milieu of house dust microbial exposures. Here, we show that mice exposed to dog-associated house dust are protected against airway allergen challenge.
> 
> This study supports the possibility that hostâ€“environment interactions that govern allergic or infectious airway disease may be mediated, at least in part, by the impact of environmental exposures on the gastrointestinal microbiome composition and, by extension, its impact on the host immune response.

In short &#8211; early childhood exposure to pets and dust causes significant immunity all your life. In fact from their <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-12/uoc--rsh121613.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-12/uoc--rsh121613.php', 'press release']);" >press release</a>,

> In their study the scientists exposed mice to cockroach or protein allergens. They discovered that asthma-associated inflammatory responses in the lungs were greatly reduced in mice previously exposed to dog-associated dust, in comparison to mice that were exposed to dust from homes without pets or mice not exposed to any dust.
> 
> Among the bacterial species in the gut microbiome of these protected mice, the researchers homed in on one, Lactobacillus johnsonii. When they fed it alone to mice, they found it could prevent airway inflammation due to allergens or even respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Severe RSV infection in infancy is associated with elevated asthma risk.
> 
> The researchers showed in this experiment that protection of the lungs&#8217; airways was associated with reduced numbers and activity of asthma-associated immune cells.
> 
> The level of protection with this single species was less than that obtained with the full complement of dust microbes from dog owners&#8217; homes, indicating that other, environmentally sourced bacterial species probably are necessary for full airway protection, Lynch said.
> 
> Lynch&#8217;s own work and research by several others in the field has led her to become convinced that &#8220;the composition and function of the gut microbiome strongly influence immune reactions and present a novel avenue for development of therapeutics for both allergic asthma and a range of other diseases.&#8221;
