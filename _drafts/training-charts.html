<p>Here is an excellent video from Matt Gary of SSPT with a deadlift chart he created based upon the principles of Prilepin's Table, to perform singles. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q3CTfHSBTg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q3CTfHSBTg</a></p>
<p>If you're really serious about your goals, I'd recommend studying up on the various forms of periodization. I'd also highly recommend picking up a copy of <a href="http://www.jtsstrength.com/store/the-juggernaut-method-2-0/" rel="nofollow">The Juggernaut Method 2.0</a>. At $50, it's pricey, but definitely an informative read on how to schedule training around multiple goals, especially those similar to yours. If you can't afford that, I'd say pick up the original Juggernaut Method (only $20). It's nowhere near as detailed as the second one, but it'll still give you an idea of where to go.</p>

<p><a href="http://stronglifts.com/madcow/5x5_Program/Periodized_5x5.htm" rel="nofollow">Bill Starr's 5x5 Periodized Program</a> calls for the volume/loading phase to be weeks 1-4, with either 2 weeks of pure deload, or a 5 week period of deload and peak. The link explains it better.</p>
