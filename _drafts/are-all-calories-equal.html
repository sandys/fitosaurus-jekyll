<p>Now, while intermittent fasting obviously allows for several smaller meals within a 4-8h time window, it seems logical that the "saturation" of glycogen synthesis could nevertheless become a problem. After all, you have read about the limited ability of our bodies to "store away" excess glycogen in previous posts on the SuppVersity and will thus be familiar with the idea that, contrary to the fat storage capacity of our adipose tissue, our bodies' glucose stores, which are located primarily in muscle and liver tissue, are very limited.</p>
<p><b>"How much fat can you really gain from a single 750g carbohydrate meal?"*</b><br />
* this is the answer to the question at the end of <a href="http://suppversity.blogspot.com/2011/09/intermittent-thoughts-on-intermittent.html">yesterday's installment</a> of the <a href="http://suppversity.blogspot.com/label/search/intermittent%20thoughts%20on%20IF"><i>Intermittent Thoughts on Intermittent Fasting</i></a> series<b> </b></p>

<p>While you may have expected that the "exact" amount of carbs your body would be able to store varies with the amount of muscle you are carrying, it may surprise you that it also varies according to which source you are using (that's science, folks!). It is, however in general assumed that an average adult human being <b>can store about 500grams of carbohydrate</b>. Athletes on the other hand could theoretically store up to 1.0-1.1kg before the onset of de novo lipogenesis, i.e. the synthesis of fatty acids from carbohydrate substrates (<a href="http://www.ajcn.org/content/48/2/240.short">Acheson. 1988</a>).</p>
<p><b>In 1988, Acheson et al. established in a series of overfeeding studies that</b><b> it takes roughly 475grams of<span style="text-decoration: underline;">excess</span> carbohydrates to manufacture and store 150grams of fat (<a href="http://www.ajcn.org/content/48/2/240.short">Acheson. 1988</a>). </b></p>
<p>You may notice that this would yield an energetic ratio of 1g of fat to 3g of carbs and thus constitutes another violation of the generally accepted oversimplified "laws of dietary thermodynamics", as they are propagated by dietitians and mainstream-media. If our bodies could inter-convert and store macronutrients as readily as people are made to believe, according to the 4kcal/9kcal energy rule, the <b>750g of carbs in my sample calculation in illustration 1 should translate into 111g of fat</b>, if 500g of the carbs had previously been stored in empty glycogen stores.</p>

<p>If you are interested in a <b>detailed discussion of the applicability of the laws of thermodynamics in a nutritional context</b>, I suggest you start by reading Richard Feinman and Eugene Fine's 2004 paper <a href="http://www.nutritionj.com/content/3/1/9"><i>"A calorie is a calorie" violates the second law of thermodynamics</i></a>, where the two scientists discuss existent data to show that thermogenesis, alone, would be sufficient to predict metabolic a metabolic advantage of low- over high-carb diets and make a point in stating that "as a general principle, 'a calorie is a calorie' violates the second law of thermodynamics."</div>
