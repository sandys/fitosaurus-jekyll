<p><strong>How much cooked millet does 1 cup millet yield?</strong><br />
1 cup dry, raw millet yields about 3 ½ cups cooked millet.</p>
<p><strong>How much liquid do I need to cook millet?</strong><br />
To cook 1 cup of millet in a pilaf-style (as described below), you'll need 2 cups of water. If you want to make a creamier porridge, increase the water to 3 cups.</p>
<p><strong>How long does it take to cook millet?</strong><br />
Millet takes a few minutes to toast, about 15 minutes to cook, and 10 minutes to fluff. All told, about 30 minutes total cook time.</p>
<p><strong>Shouldn't I always rinse my grains before cooking them?</strong><br />
Not necessarily. The only grain I habitually rinse is quinoa because of its bitter coating, saponin. I don't find it necessary or beneficial to rinse millet. Sometimes you'll see little black pebble-like bits in your millet, and these are simply the unhulled grain. Just pick them out and continue on.</p>
