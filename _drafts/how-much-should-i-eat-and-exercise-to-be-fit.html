<p>There is a whole bunch of superstition around the correct constitution of diets (low carb, high carb, no carb), timing (dont eat at night, eat 10 times a day), etc. When it comes to exercise programs, there is even more confusion and <em>gurus </em>to go around - your friendly neighborhood gym trainer foremost amongst them.</p>
<p>This article does not attempt to touch those topics - it actually answers something far more simpler and quantifiable: <em><strong>How much</strong></em><strong> </strong><em></em><em></em>to eat/exercise.</p>
<p>Now, why is this important ? Hasnt your friendly neighborhood dietician asked you to eat your cucumbers and almonds and stop counting calories ? or eat 1 litre of ghee and dont bother counting ?</p>
<p>The answer takes us all the way from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Taubes">Gary Taubes </a>to the GOMAD (Gallon of Milk a Day) diet to 2-DEAD (Two Dozen Eggs A Day) diet and back again.</p>
<p>The answer is about insulin, leptin and exercise.</p>
<p>the EPOC is by far not the only metabolic effect that's missing from the "standard equation of exercise induced weight loss", i.e. [calorie intake - (resting metabolic rate + calories burnt during exercise)] / [3,500 kcal/lbs] = amount of fat lost (in lbs). In fact that is evident in the <a href="http://fitosaur.us/hiit-15-minutes-per-day-for-efficient-fat-loss-409/">HIIT article</a> on this site, where I mention  the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rosenkilde%20M%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=22855277">Rosenkilde</a> study (of increased aerobic volume not really losing more weight)</p>

<p>Two essential, nutrition-related, tenets need to be followed by weightlifters to maximize muscle hypertrophy: the consumption of 1.2-2.0 g protein.kg -1 of body weight, and ≥44-50 kcal.kg-1 of body weight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22470009</p>
<p>However, there is still no consensus in the literature about the quantity and quality of protein capable of reducing or maintaining blood-glucose concentrations at the desirable range, without causing adverse effects. The difference in the results of the studies may be associated to methodological problems presented by these studies.</p>

<p>acute endurance exercise performed ~12–16 h prior to consumption of a high-fat meal can attenuate the increases in TG and systemic oxidative stress otherwise observed following a high-fat meal (Petitt and Cureton <a title="Link to bibliographic citation" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/phy2.40/full#phy240-bib-0028" rel="references:#phy240-bib-0028" shape="rect">2003</a>; MacEneaney et al. <a title="Link to bibliographic citation" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/phy2.40/full#phy240-bib-0020" rel="references:#phy240-bib-0020" shape="rect">2009</a>; Jenkins et al. <a title="Link to bibliographic citation" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/phy2.40/full#phy240-bib-0016" rel="references:#phy240-bib-0016" shape="rect">2011</a>; Gabriel et al. <a title="Link to bibliographic citation" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/phy2.40/full#phy240-bib-0013" rel="references:#phy240-bib-0013" shape="rect">2012</a>; Klop et al. <a title="Link to bibliographic citation" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/phy2.40/full#phy240-bib-0018" rel="references:#phy240-bib-0018" shape="rect">2012</a>). An acute exercise bout can ameliorate the lipemic and insulin response to a high-fat meal (see Petitt and Cureton <a title="Link to bibliographic citation" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/phy2.40/full#phy240-bib-0028" rel="references:#phy240-bib-0028" shape="rect">2003</a> for review),</p>

<h1>The science of muscle hypertrophy: making dietary protein count.</h1>
<p>Thus, the combined evidence suggests a strategic advantage of practising early post-exercise consumption of whey protein or dairy-based protein to promote muscle protein synthesis, net muscle protein accretion and ultimately hypertrophy.</p>
