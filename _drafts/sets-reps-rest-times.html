<p>According to the results the scientists present in their latest paper, strength programs with different relaxation times, namely 45s, 90s, 180s between 4 sets of 8 reps for squats and bench presses don't lead to different increases in strength gains. Since previous studies appear to suggest that shorter rest times and combining those with lower resistance "pump" exercises (I know that sounds very BB-bro-wisdom like, but is supported by e.g. Goto. 2004; cf.<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15574075" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15574075</a>) would be the preferred rest time for muscle gains, it appears as if it was time to kick the lazy 3 min rest periods from your training regimen... even if the differences may not be ALL THAT pronounced <i></i></p>

<p>There is no getting around the fact that a program of <em>only</em> heavy weights and low reps builds significantly more strength and size than a program of <em>only</em> lighter weight and higher reps. So if you are trying to decide what reps you should <em>exclusively </em>be doing, pick reps less than 20.  But, this study also clearly shows that that conventional strength training thought is inaccurate to some degree. Higher reps do increase strength and size.</p>
<p>What the research hasn’t told us is how higher reps built strength and size. What physiological mechanism is at play that causes higher reps to build both strength and size?  If there are different physiological reasons for how low reps build strength and how higher reps build strength, then it raises a fascinating question.  What if you combined low reps with higher reps? What would the results be? If different physiological mechanisms are responsible for the increases in strength and size at different reps then would a combination program of different reps result in better results than single rep programs?  As we have seen higher reps do increase strength and size and if they build strength due to a different mechanism than lower reps there may be some advantage in combining lower rep training with higher rep training.</p>
<p>This study doesn’t answer the question but<strong> <a title="Muscle Factor Training – a new paradigm" href="http://trainingscience.net/?page_id=471">this one </a></strong>does.  In the meantime, the point is that light weight and high reps are not really “endurance” exercises; high reps are both strength and endurance training and the degree to which they affect strength or endurance depends on the number of reps being</p>

<p><strong>What about alternating rep ranges?</strong></p>
<p>The studies cited above have compared one rep range to another, high reps vs. low reps for example.  In every study researchers had subjects perform just one rep range and in each case heavy weights / low reps increased strength the most.  What the researchers never examined was how a program of multiple rep ranges compared to a program consisting of a single rep range.</p>
<p>In 2004 a group of researchers tackled this very question in a fascinating study of varying combinations of high and low rep training (8).  This group speculated that a combination type program that included both low and high reps would be more effective than a periodized program consisting of single repetition scheme during each training period or phase.</p>
<p>To test their hypothesis they recruited 17 untrained subjects, divided them into two groups, and then trained each group twice per week for 10 weeks.  Subjects were tested for maximum strength and muscular endurance pre- and post-training.  The first 6 weeks of training was designated as phase 1 and both groups trained exactly the same during this phase. Workouts consisted of two exercises (leg extensions &amp; leg presses) for 3 sets x 10-15 reps.  At the end of this first phase of training there was no difference between the groups; both had significantly and equally improved strength and endurance.  This is not surprising since both groups trained exactly the same during phase 1.</p>
<p>During the final 4 weeks of the study, both groups conducted 5 sets x 3-5 reps of each exercise.  One group, the combi-type group, added a single set of 25-35 reps following their final low rep set.  At the end of the training program the combi-type group had increased their strength 58% more than did the other training group (14.7% vs. 9.3% respectively).  The results are displayed in table 2.</p>
