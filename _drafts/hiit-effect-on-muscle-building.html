<div dir="ltr" data-angle="0" data-font-name="Times" data-canvas-width="46.310801700210575"><b>Bottom line + important reminder: </b> Despite the fact that the increase in citrate synthase (CitSyn; cf. <i>Figure 1</i>) didn't reach statistical significance, the overall increase in mitochondrial protein (COX I and IV) will still allow for an increase in fatty acid oxidation during exercise. If you still believe that HIIT sessions were mainly used to lose body fat you are totally off track. The total calorie expenditure is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">way</span> too low to have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> effect on your body fat levels.The thing HIIT is good for is what you see in the study at hand. It's a mitochondrial builder that will ramp up PGC-1α, increases the mitochondrial firepower of your cells and promote the oxidative <span style="text-decoration: underline;">capacity</span> of their power houses. How you use this increased "firepower", i.e. to run faster or longer <i>or</i> to burn a couple of additional calories while you are doing steady state cardio, play basketball or perform any other kind of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">aerobic</span> activity to promote the baseline fat loss effects of your diet, is up to you, though.</div>
