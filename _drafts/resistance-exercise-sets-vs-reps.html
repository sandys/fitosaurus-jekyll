<p>there was this study that compared the impact of varying number of reps in a set vs number of sets overall. If I remember correctly, the conclusion was that the number of sets does not impact muscle growth as much as varying number of reps as part of your training regimen.</p>
<p>do note that I'm already aware that high rep/low weight is less effective than low rep/high weight - but this question is about whether varying between the two is better than sticking to the high weight.</p>
<p>I did find this study - <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15574075">Muscular adaptations to combinations of high- and low-intensity resistance exercises.</a>, which does mention that doing both is better than either one.</p>

<p>A study with trainees with on average 4.2 ± 2.4 years of training experience (range of 1.5 to 10 years) that deals with the  question whether 3x10 or 7x3 would be the optimal set x rep range for strength and size gains.</p>
<p>Result - 7x3 is better.</p>

<p><b></b>If we go solely by the results of the study at hand, it would appear prudent to add a set or two to your training regimen. In view of the fact that most of you will probably be training according to a body-part split, I doubt that you will be doing significantly less than 5 sets for any of your muscle groups, anyway. In view of the absence of beneficial effects on the body composition and considering the fact that the arms, of all muscle groups, were the only ones that grew significantly, it's still questionable how beneficial a volume increase in 2015 would be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15574075">Muscular adaptations to combinations of high- and low-intensity resistance exercises</a> </strong>investigate the effects of a combined low-rep and high-rep resistance training program on muscular strength and size. This is fairly similar to how a periodization routine would work. The subjects were divided into two groups: a combined training group (8 subjects) and a normal group (9 subjects). For the first 6-week block, both groups performed the same training program, which involved a standard hypertrophy workout comprising 9 sets of steadily decreasing loads from 80 – 40% of 1M with 30-seconds between sets in batches of 3 sets, with 3 minutes of rest between batches. For the remaining 4 weeks, the groups performed different training programs. The combined group performed 5 sets of 90% of 1RM with 3-minutes of rest between sets plus 1 set at 50% of 1RM. The normal group performed just 5 sets of 90% of 1RM with 3-minutes of rest between sets. At the end of 4 weeks, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">combined training group tended to display greater improvements in most measurements taken.</span></p>
<p>There were important limitations to this study, as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The combined program involved more volume than the normal routine. The results obtained by the combined program may have resulted simply from more mechanical loading due to greater volume of weight lifted.</li>
<li>The study period was only 4 weeks. Studies comparing differences in muscular size typically require 6 – 10 weeks in order to measure significantly different results between groups because of the small increases in muscular size that occur in shorter periods and because of significantly different individual responses to hypertrophic stimuli.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>strength programs with different relaxation times, namely 45s, 90s, 180s between 4 sets of 8 reps for squats and bench presses don't lead to different increases in strength gains. Since previous studies appear to suggest that shorter rest times and combining those with lower resistance "pump" exercises (I know that sounds very BB-bro-wisdom like, but is supported by e.g. Goto. 2004; cf.<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15574075" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15574075</a>) would be the preferred rest time for muscle gains, it appears as if it was time to kick the lazy 3 min rest periods from your training regimen... even if the differences may not be ALL THAT pronounced</p>
