<p>Cardio burns &gt;40% of the muscle fat, doubles lipolytic protein expression and increases the total oxidative capacity of obese men within 8 weeks.</p>
<p>All subjects started with 20min of cycling or running at only 30% of their VO2max and were encouraged to try to build up to 20-60min of exercise at a maximal intensity of 85% of the VO2-max.</p>
<p>How much weight did 102kg guys lose? Not a single pound! But this is not about losing weight - to do that you would use your diet (!), not your workouts - training is about building the engine to burn fat and that worked quite effectively with a protocol that was frequent (5 sessions per week), and progressive.<a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.suppversity.com&amp;h=uAQFjuLLKAQFzE2nv1yp7wZ0SHeHHBLA38jDkF-lLLfs7Yg&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">www.suppversity.com</a></p>

<p>Effect of prior exercise on postprandial lipemia: HIIT &gt; Cardio &gt; Strength training</p>
<p>A soon-to-be-published review in the Journal of Physiology says:</p>
<p>+ women benefit more from working out before a meal<br />
+ HIIT has the greatest benefit on postprandial triglyceride levels<br />
+ being in a coloric deficit doubles the effect size</p>
<p>With less than 1/10 of the effect of HIIT and a 4.5x lower effect size than 'regular cardio' strength training alone (!) is not really suited for someone who wants to keep his blood lipids in check. <a href="http://www.suppversity.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">www.suppversity.com</a></p>
