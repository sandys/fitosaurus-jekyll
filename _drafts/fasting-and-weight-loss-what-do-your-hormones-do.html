<p>In recent times, the whole idea of intermittent fasting has become a rage to create a sustainable lifestyle around weight loss and fat control. In its most basic elements, it subscribes a minimum 16-18 hour fast every day or having two 24-hour fasts per week. IF has recently attracted attention because experimental studies have highlighted its potential for correcting metabolic abnormalities. This regimen has also shown better adherence than other methods because of its sustainability over a lifetime.</p>
<p>In this article, I will attempt to understand the basic changes in your body's biochemistry and hormonal responses as well as how to build a lifestyle centred around fasting.</p>
<h2>What really happens to your body in a fast ?</h2>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The human body stores glycogen in the liver - glycogen is the body's primary source of fuel storage. So it is the level one storage when the body needs glucose quickly (level 2 would be, of course fats).  The rate of glycogen consumption in the human liver upon fasting (assuming you're doing no exercise) is about 0.3mmol/kg liver tissue per minute (based on <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4771102">this</a> paper). The average human being stores roughly 300mmol/kg glycogen in his/her liver, giving you approximately 16 hours for depletion (credit goes to Martin Berkhan for that calculation).</p>
<p>Traditionally, biochemistry studies recognize three different states of the body:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The well-fed, or postabsorptive, state</i> - A typical meal takes 3-5 hours to be completely digested and absorped (yes!! your fasting does not even start for 3 hours after a meal). Once a meal has been completely absorbed, the body enters the post-absorptive state. At this point, several important biochemical triggers start happening :
<ul>
<li>glucose and amino acids are transported from the intestine to the blood.</li>
<li>dietary lipids are transported to the blood by the lymphatic system</li>
<li>The most important - secretion of the hormone <i>insulin</i> by the β cells of the pancreas (stimulated by glucose and the parasympathetic nervous system). Effectively, insulin signals the well-fed stage—it stimulates the storage of fuels and the synthesis of proteins in a variety of ways (e.g. protein kinase cascades— glycogen synthesis in muscles+liver and stops gluconeogenesis by the liver)</li>
<li>Insulin accelerates the uptake of blood glucose into the liver by GLUT2 - causing glycogen synthesis (remember glycogen synthesis happens both in the muscles and the liver).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>the early-fasting state </em>- As blood-glucose level continues to drop several hours after a meal, it leads to a drop in insulin secretion and a rise in <i>glucagon</i> secretion. glucagon signals the starved state - it targets the liver to stimulate glycogen synthesis by triggering the cyclic AMP cascade. Glucagon also inhibits fatty acid synthesis by diminishing the production of pyruvate and stimulates gluconeogenesis in the liver. The large amount of glucose formed by these processes are released by the liver into the blood stream. As the blood glucose drops, both muscle and liver use fatty acids as fuel</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, as the human body proceeds in its fast, it starts switching to lipids/fatty acids for energy production and tries to conserve precious glycogen (which does get consumed a little slower, anyway). In fact, a very recent <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23274906">study</a> shows that dietary protein is not contributing to net glucose production.<br />
Most of the literature that you find around fasting is based on experiments done on mice. However, in recent times, scientists have identified that there are a set of people who naturally undergo the exact definition of fasting as is recommended in IF (intermittent fasting). These are people observing Ramadan/Ramzan.</p>
<p>The prescribed diet mode in Ramzan is to eat before sunrise and eat after sunset - implicitly bringing about a 14 hour fast atleast. During this time, people do not ingest any other form of calories (including milk, sugar, etc.).</p>

<p>No significant changes were observed on serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL levels. HDL levels were significantly elevated during Ramadan (p &lt; 0.001) and 20 days after Ramadan (p &lt; 0.05). Prothrombin time, aPTT, fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were in the physiologic limits in all samples but D-dimer levels were significantly low at the end of Ramadan in comparison to pre- and post-fasting levels (p &lt; 0.001). Homocysteine levels, being still in reference ranges, were low during Ramadan (p &lt; 0.05) and reached the pre-fasting levels after Ramadan.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate that intermittent fasting led to some beneficial changes in serum HDL and plasma homocysteine levels, and the coagulation status. These changes may be due to omitting at least one meal when the body was particularly metabolically active and possibly had a low blood viscosity level at the same time. We conclude that intermittent fasting may have beneficial effects on hemostatic risk markers for cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<p>No significant changes were observed in serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL levels. TC/HDL ratio (HDL risk factor) was decreased during and after Ramadan in both genders in the fasting group while there were no changes in the nonfasting group. IL-6 (p &lt; 0.001), CRP (p &lt; 0.001) and homocysteine (p &lt; 0.01) levels were significantly low during Ramadan in the fasting subjects of both genders when compared to basal values (1 week before Ramadan).</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate that prolonged intermittent fasting in a model like Ramadan has some positive effects on the inflammatory status of the body and on the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases such as homocysteine, CRP and TC/HDL ratio.</p>

<p>Above was a very interesting study done on 24 individuals during Ramzan and showed interesting changes in the body during the fasting process. One very interesting question that is raised is that <em>serum total cholesterol</em> was not altered during this whole process. So where is the benefit coming from ?</p>
<p>The answer is around insulin resistance. See cholesterol as a marker for poor cardiac health was always a weak one - however, you could look at insulin responses of the body and understand or predict to a very large extent, the overall fat mass and cardiac health.</p>
