<p>As alluded to previously, the effects of whey on muscle adaptations may not be solely dependent upon its EAA concentration. A study that may confuse that argument was one in which the consumption of 15 g of EAA almost doubled the muscle protein balance in elderly subjects, compared to consuming whey [<cite><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2F1743-7075-7-51/fulltext.html#CR118_263">118</a></cite>]. Of note, however, the subjects consumed isocaloric amounts of either EAA or whey, and thus the whey trial consisted of ~50% less EAA. From this study, it would appear that whey may be energetically less efficient than consumption of its constituent EAA for increasing muscle protein balance, at least for elderly individuals, as its constituent non-essential amino acids do not seem to be as important in enhancing protein balance/synthesis [<cite><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2F1743-7075-7-51/fulltext.html#CR3_263">3</a></cite>, <cite><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2F1743-7075-7-51/fulltext.html#CR108_263">108</a></cite>, <cite><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2F1743-7075-7-51/fulltext.html#CR109_263">109</a></cite>]. Contrastingly, acute whey PRO ingestion (15 g), under resting conditions and in elderly men and women, resulted in greater muscle protein balance than consumption of its constituent EAAs (6.72 g) or non-essential amino acids (7.57 g) [<cite><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2F1743-7075-7-51/fulltext.html#CR10_263">10</a></cite>]. This result may suggest that something other than EAAs within whey are important for muscle hypertrophy.</p>
