<p>In a previous <a href="http://fitosaur.us/calcium-myths-and-facts-600/">post</a>, I have tried to address some of the myths around Vitamin-D and especially that pertaining to Calcium.</p>
<p>Vitamin D binding protein and kidney cancer - 83% reduced risk with high, not low levels</p>
<p>It's funny, only a couple of days ago I told you about the beneficial metabolic effects (glucose and lipid metabolism) of FREE vitamin D and how this may render all previous studies that measured total vitamin D, only, meaningless.</p>
<p>Sugested Read: "Underestimated Vitamin D Sources: Especially Eggs, But Also Chicken, Pork, Fish &amp; Dairy Contain an Overlooked, Physiologically Relevant Amount of Ready-Made 25OHD" @ <a href="http://www.suppversity.com/2013/11/underestimated-vitamin-d-sources.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">www.suppversity.com/2013/11/<wbr />underestimated-vitamin-d-source<wbr />s.html</a></p>
<p>Today, I have to add that at your kidney is going to be happier with HIGH vitamin D binging proteins (and thus low free vitamin D) and low free vitamin D [you could argue that this is logical as high active vitamin D levels entail the risk of kidney calcification; if more D is bound, this problem should be reduced]</p>
<p>That's at least what the significant negative association between vitamin D binding protein and kidney cancer scientists from the National Cancer Institute found, when they re-analyzed data from the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study, would suggest. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.suppversity.com&amp;h=0AQGBAuIq&amp;enc=AZPnbYvPXL2PSURt-yF3Efv2yF46txkHTMZ4jJ-eZ-SSs_MwqAlkb1YbBZVZ5qVdAba24qzyRBuoATlk4SNXEYKgBGCPHc8VrRS9MRENS06bLCapoIwJx85KZnixqpqn88mcQ4a2Flc82EtDNkFgFnTR&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">www.suppversity.com</a></p>
