<p>Want to reduce your hypertension risk? Here are a couple of suggestions:</p>
<p>1) Be active - daily physical activity = -20% risk<br />
2) Eat fish - 4+ times fatty fish per week = -60% risk</p>
<p>You want to increase, not decrease it? Well that's easier: Get obese or start smoking and you are in for a +360% increased risk of hypertension...</p>
<p>... at least if your body works similar to that of the 1410 participants of a recent study from Macau. www-suppversity.com</p>
