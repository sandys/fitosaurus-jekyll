<h5 data-ft="{&quot;type&quot;:1,&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}">If you are trying to improve your cholesterol levels with vitamin D3 supplements, don't forget the statin!</p>
<p>An international team of scientists found that the purported cholesterol lowering effect of statins occur only in patients on statin therapy. For the rest of the subjects in this controlled trial the titrated supplementation of vitamin D3 at dosages of 1,000-3,000 IU per day "had no effect on cholesterol or cholesterol subfractions".</p>
<p>Even in the patients on concomittant atorvastatin therapy, the changes in cholesterol or cholesterol subfractions were not significant. Obviously the minimally reduced absorption of dietary cholesterol was (as it was to be expected) easily buffered by the endogenous cholesterol production. That's at least what the scientists believe:</p>
<p>"Vitamin D lipid-lowering effects appear limited to statin-treated patients and are likely due to decreased cholesterol absorption."</p>
<p>A nice side-finding of the study is that it was AGAIN (see <a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2Foxxspnw&amp;h=tAQHcHZ3yAQGtlEhcQ_N4afPXJnUuNuMUYooxoW3qqKHVeQ&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/oxxspnw</a>) the FREE vitamin D level, but not the commonly measured total 25-OHD level that was measurably associated with the lipid levels. <a href="http://www.suppversity.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">www.suppversity.com</a></p>
